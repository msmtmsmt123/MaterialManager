Cabinet
=======

Cabinet is a minimal file manager designed for Android 4.1 and above.
Since I'm now in college and no longer have time to maintain and update it, I made it open source so that other people could learn from it or maybe even make improvements and submit pull requests.

Translation changes/additions don't belong here, they belong on http://cabinet.oneskyapp.com/.
